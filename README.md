# Ransomware Behavior Simulation and Detection 🛡️

This project is an educational ransomware behavior simulation developed using Python. The main purpose of this project is to understand how ransomware attacks work and how such attacks can be identified using behavior-based detection techniques. The project is created strictly for learning and academic purposes.

⚠️ This project does **not** contain real malware and does **not** cause any harm to the system or user data.

## Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- To study the basic behavior of ransomware attacks
- To safely simulate file encryption activities
- To implement simple behavior-based detection logic
- To gain practical exposure to cybersecurity concepts

---

## Project Overview
In this project, ransomware-like behavior is simulated in a controlled environment. The simulator performs actions such as accessing files in a test directory and renaming or encrypting them in a safe manner. At the same time, a detection module monitors these activities and checks for suspicious patterns.

If abnormal behavior is detected, the system generates an alert indicating possible ransomware activity.

## Features
- Safe and controlled ransomware behavior simulation
- No real data is damaged or lost
- Behavior-based detection mechanism
- Simple and beginner-friendly implementation using Python
- Suitable for academic demonstrations and learning

---

## Technologies Used
- Python programming language
- OS and file handling libraries
- Basic monitoring and detection logic

---

## How the Project Works
1. The simulator accesses files inside a test folder created by the user
2. Controlled file operations such as renaming or encryption are performed
3. The detection module continuously monitors file activity
4. When suspicious behavior crosses a predefined threshold, an alert is raised
5. The process is flagged as ransomware-like for analysis

## How to Run the Project
1. Install Python (version 3.x)
2. Create a folder with dummy files for testing
3. Run the ransomware simulator:
